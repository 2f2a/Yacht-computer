When encounter a new wifi network where SSID and password need to be entered into the OrangePi 
server a cable can be used between the laptop (which provide both SSID and password, as we need 
to enter it into it). 

Just connect the units with a RJ45 cable and select "Shared with other computers" instead of the 
more common "Automatic (DHCP)".  After a few seconds the ifconfig command will show an ipaddress 
on the eth0, ifconfig eth0.

This is the laptop's eth0 ad-hoc network address. To find the OrangePi units's address we need to 
issue an arp comand, arc -a.It will whow an ip address associated with eth0.

Then it's simple matter of logging in to the OrangePi using ssh.
