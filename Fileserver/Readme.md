Exchange of photos and multimedia files on board.

Very often files and photos need to be shared and exchanged. This project sets up a very small file server using SAMBA, NFS and sshFS/SFTP to enable laptops, phones and pads to upload, download, share and exchange photos, music and other files.

Connection over wifi and bluetooth.
