# Wifi 2 wifi gateway using long range USB antenna


## Wifi is desperately needed

A wifi 2 wifi gateway using a Raspberry Pi and a long range USB high
gain antenna to provide local wifi coverage onboard is a must when
cruising. In addition it should be easy to use, any member of the crew
should ba able to select a shore station. They comes in all variants,
sometimes a code is posted and some times you'll need a reciept to get
the code etc etc the list is endless. On common fact is that they
generally do not offer connection below deck. Using a high gain
antenna outside to pick up the signal from a marina or a caf√© and get
a reliable connection and then provide this connection to a local wifi
(cable also) segment onboard is a nice way of solving this
chellenge. While commercial solution do exsists (like Redbox), they
are generally expensive and bundled with a lot of other functions not
needed for this purpose.
