A wifi 2 wifi gateway using a Raspberry Pi and a long range USB high
gain antenna to provide local wifi coverage onboard is a must when
cruising. In addition it should be easy to use, any member of the crew
should ba able to select a shore station. They comes in all variants,
sometimes a code is posted and some times you'll need a reciept to get
the code etc etc the list is endless.
