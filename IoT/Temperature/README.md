# Temperature sensor 

## ESP-8266 breadboard layout

### 1-wire sensors 


I have used an ESP-12E NodeMCU 1.0 board from China in for this
project. The software development environment is Arduino IDE which
relies on the (close enough) C programming language.

The temperature sensor project has [web pages](https://sites.google.com/site/olewsaa/yacht-server-with-raspberry/temperature-monitoring) about the project with overview and pictures of the 
hardware in addition a description and ideas behind the setup.
